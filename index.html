                    Subhash Chandra Bose's birthday is on the 23rd of January 1897,
                    Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose was born in Cuttack. He was born to
                    Janakinath Bose and Prabhavati Dutt. He was an Indian nationalist in
                    the era of British colonialism in India whose defiant patriotism and
                    immovable nerve and bravery made him a national hero whose praises
                    are still sung with pride by every Indian citizen. His attempts to
                    get rid of the British with the help of the Nazi party and Imperial
                    Japan during the time of the second world war left him a troubled
                    legacy. Although every Indian feels proud by hearing his name, it
                    was not the case during the freedom struggle, especially in the INC
                    where he often faced clashes of ideologies with Gandhiji and he did
                    not get the recognition that he deserved. Let us take a look into
                    the life of this extraordinary yet unsung hero. In honour of his
                    contribution to the freedom struggle recently it was announced that
                    his birthday is celebrated as “PARAKRAM DIWAS” as “parakram”
                    translates to courage in English thereby recognizing his immense
                    contribution by calling his birthday the day of courage. The day
                    will now be commemorated each year in memory of Netaji Subhash
                    Chandra Bose, the unsung hero of the Indian independence struggle!
                    Let us look at the Subhash Chandra Bose Biography and know our hero,
                    in and out!
